A sophisticated machine learning initiative to train the Aurora AI model, designed for advanced natural language processing and predictive tasks.

## Overview
Aurora integrates a Transformer-based architecture with embeddings from the Ollama `llama3` model, enabling robust performance on custom datasets. This project provides a GUI-driven training pipeline, leveraging PyTorch and CUDA for optimized computation.

## Features
- **Model Architecture**: TransformerEncoder with 6 layers, 12 attention heads, and an embedding dimension of 4096 (sourced from LLaMA 3).
- **Training Configuration**:
  - Batch Size: 32
  - Epochs: 10
  - Dataset Size: 1000 entries (configurable via GUI)
  - Validation Split: 20%
- **Hardware Optimization**: CUDA-enabled for NVIDIA GPUs (e.g., RTX 3060), with fallback to CPU.
- **Embedding Source**: Local Ollama server (`http://127.0.0.1:11434`).
- **User Interface**: PyQt5-based GUI for parameter tuning and progress tracking.

## Why We Wanted to Make This
The Aurora project was born from a desire to democratize advanced AI development by combining state-of-the-art Transformer models with accessible, open-source tools like Ollama. We aimed to create a flexible, GPU-accelerated training framework that empowers researchers and hobbyists alike to experiment with large-scale language models without requiring enterprise-level resources. Our goal was to bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI research and practical, hands-on implementation, fostering innovation in a rapidly evolving field.

## Requirements
- **Python**: 3.8 or higher
- **PyTorch**: With CUDA support (`pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118`)
- **Ollama**: Local server running `llama3` model
- **Dependencies**: `pip install pyqt5 requests`
- **Hardware**: NVIDIA GPU recommended (e.g., RTX 3060 with 6 GB VRAM), 16+ GB RAM

## Installation
1. Clone or download this project:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ProjectAurora.git
   cd ProjectAurora

    Install dependencies:
    bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Start the Ollama server:
bash

    ollama run llama3

Usage

Launch the training script:
bash
python aurora.py

    Adjust num_entries, epochs, or other parameters via the GUI.
    Monitor progress in the "Output Log" and QProgressBar.

Performance

    Initialization: ~70 minutes (fetching 30,522 embeddings from Ollama at ~0.13 sec/token).
    Training: ~13 minutes (10 epochs, 320 batches at ~0.25 sec/batch on RTX 3060).
    Total Time: ~83 minutes.
    Logs: Check aurora.log for detailed HTTP requests and training metrics.
